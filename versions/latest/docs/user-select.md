# Turn off element selectability

The user-select CSS property controls whether the user can select text. This doesn't have any effect on content loaded as part of a browser's user interface (its chrome), except in textboxes.

- .select-auto
- .select-none

```css
.select-auto {
  user-select: auto;
}
.select-none {
  user-select: none;
}
```
